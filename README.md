• Designed and implemented a fault-tolerant key/value storage system using the Raft consensus algorithm, ensuring
consistent replication of data across multiple servers for high availability.
• Developed and integrated leader election, log replication, and failure recovery mechanisms to maintain state consistency
and support seamless recovery of nodes after crashes or network issues.
• Implemented RPC communication between nodes for synchronizing log entries and integrated persistent state storage,
allowing nodes to recover from failures while ensuring continued operation as long as a majority of nodes are functional.
